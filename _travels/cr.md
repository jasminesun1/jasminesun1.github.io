  ## Must Dos/Notes
  - 17 Mile Drive: Good way to see the area but I'd only bother stopping at Point Joe, Bird Rock, Crocker Grove, and the Lone Cypress unless you really have time
  - Take your time exploring downtown Carmel, it's so pretty
  - Build a sandwich at Bruno's
  - Point Lobos has a bunch of easy trails with amazing views
  - Lowkey I feel like July or August would be the best time to visit bc May was still 60s and cloudy
