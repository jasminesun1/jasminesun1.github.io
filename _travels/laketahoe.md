  ## Must Dos/Notes
  - Cave Rock at sunset: It's very dusty and steep/rocky in some parts, so wear sneakers you don't care about
  - Tahoe Bagel Company: get a bagel sandwich
  - Base Camp Pizza: The pizza was ok but the artichoke dip app was really good
  - Skunk Harbor: Super super beautiful and pretty empty!! Wear sneakers for the hike tho because it's a decent amount of elevation gain (flip flops are not the move don't do it)
  - Paddleboard
