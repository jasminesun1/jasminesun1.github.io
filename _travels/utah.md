  ## Must Dos/Notes
  - Cable Mountain Lodge is a really good location for Zion (literally right next to the park, next to gear rental, next to restaurants)
  - Angel's Landing was lots of fun but genuinely just for the love of the game... views are great everywhere, not just at the top
  - Bryce Canyon hikes are solid but Bryce Canyon City is not a city at all
  - Get dinner at Thai Bella. 
  - Make your own shirt at the T-Shirt Shop in Moab
  - Would spend more time in Moab. There are lots of cool activities like offroading, rafting, stargazing, etc.
  - Idk if I was sick of seeing these red rocks by the time we got to Canyonlands or if it's just underwhelming, but I don't think it was worth the time... I'd just do something fun in Moab/Arches instead
